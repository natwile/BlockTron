# BlockTron
This is a little terminal based text game that was created to apply skills learned from:
  - Data Structures
  - Computer Systems

This is more based with data structures as it uses many skills from that class such as:
  - File Input & Output
  - Linked List of Linked Lists
  - Exceptions & Try/Catch
  - Random Number Generation

There are also the more general or more simple skills such as:
  - Binary Bits as Memory
  - Binary to Unsigned Integers
  - Arrays, Loops, Pointers, Constants
  - Classes and Object Oriented Programming

File Structure:  Memory.cpp  ->  Functions.cpp  ->  FrontEnd.cpp  ->  game.cpp
(Linked Lists & File I/O), (Helper Functions to Frontend), (UI, Play Functions, Map), (Main Method)
